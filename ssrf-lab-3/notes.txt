SSRF with blacklist-based input filter

Vulnerable feature - This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system. To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user Carlos.

Goal - Change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user Carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.

Analysis:

localhost:: http://127.1/
admin interface: http://127.1/%25%36%31dmin
delete Carlos : http://127.1/%25%36%31dmin/delete?username=carlos

- URL decoding one time check
- regex search using a blacklist of strings
